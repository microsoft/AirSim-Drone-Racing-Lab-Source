# Point Clouds

Moved here from [https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/wiki/Point-Clouds](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim/wiki/Point-Clouds)

A Python script [point_cloud.py](https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/PythonClient/multirotor/point_cloud.py) shows how to convert the depth image returned from AirSim into a point cloud.

The following depth image was captured using the Modular Neighborhood environment:

![depth](images/depth.png)

And with the appropriate projection matrix, the OpenCV `reprojectImageTo3D` function can turn this into a point cloud.  The following is the result, which is also available here: [https://skfb.ly/68r7y](https://skfb.ly/68r7y).

[SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com) can upload the resulting file `cloud.asc` and render it for you.

PS: you may notice the scene is reflected on the Y axis, so I may have a sign wrong in the projection matrix.  An exercise for the reader :-)
